## üîë Obtaining an API Key

An API key from either OpenAI or Cohere is a requirement to use CyberForge.

### OpenAI API Keys

To obtain an OpenAI API key, please navigate to the following document for step-by-step instructions.

[![Create OpenAI API Key](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_OpenAI-API_Key-5A3EBA?style=for-the-badge&logo=openai&logoColor=white)](openai.md)

> üí∞ Please note that you must purchase credits or add your payment details in order to use OpenAI models.

### Cohere API Keys

To obtain a Cohere API key, please navigate to the following document for step-by-step instructions.

[![Create Cohere API Key](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_Cohere-API_Key-5A3EBA?style=for-the-badge&logo=cohere&logoColor=white)](cohere.md)

> üí∞ Please note that free trial API keys have rate limits, and to use CyberForge to its full potential, a paid production key is required.


## üê≥¬†Install with Docker

- You will first need to install the Docker Desktop app ([https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))

<img width="1479" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-18 at 3 59 41‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84e6a787-5e80-4f80-8b11-c280e374c707" />

### Make sure your API keys are set as environment variables:

- Environment variables allow the operating system to read in the API keys and use them in the application. 

Rename .env.example (located in the root of the project) to .env and add in your API key(s).

<img width="399" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-20 at 2 59 15‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb107d0c-45c8-4cec-ae26-4ace16b69654" />

Fill in the "" portion with the actual API key(s).

<img width="192" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-18 at 1 52 54‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17d9d26-6b69-4fb0-8496-f9a85dbf88d9" />

----- OR -----

Set the environment variables by typing the following commands into a new terminal instance and fill in the "" portion with the actual API key.

```
Windows:
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY=""

Mac/Linux:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

### Start with Docker

Once the environment variables are set, run the following command to start the application. 

```bash
docker compose up
```

### App Navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Upload your policies** (PDF only)
   - Don‚Äôt have any policies? You can:
     - Demo with our sample documents from a fictitious Finance company ‚ÄúMaple Trust‚Äù. Simply click *Use Sample Documents* on the home page of CyberForge.
     - Use our provided policy templates and government guides, located in the in the ***guides*** folder, to create your own policies for your organization.
2. **Select a cybersecurity framework**:
   - NIST CSF
   - SMO Controls
   - CIS Controls
3. **Review outputs**:
   - üß† Top Threats
   - üìà Control Scores - with suggested actions to improve
   - üìë Suggested document improvements
   - üçÅ¬†PIPEDA Results
   - üí¨¬†Chat with the AI assistant for policy questions
4. **Wish to restart?**
   - Simply navigate back to [localhost:5173/onboarding](http://localhost:5173/onboarding) to restart.
   - Please note that once you restart, the PDFs you've uploaded are reset, and you will have to upload a new set of policies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the frontend or backend process is killed and then started again, the PDFs are also reset, and you will have to upload a new set of policies.

> üìã Chat history is preserved across sessions and restarts - allowing you to have a comprehensive overview of your chats at all times. 

## üî© Switching LLM Models and Providers

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We suggest using OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models, and Cohere's Command A and Command R models. However, you can experiment with other OpenAI and Cohere models as you prefer.

- To switch the LLM provider being used, navigate to ```config.py``` and switch the **DEFAULT_PROVIDER** variable to either **openai** or **cohere**.
- Similarly, to switch the LLM being used, navigate to ```config.py``` and switch the ***openai*** or **cohere** entry in the **DEFAULT_MODELS** variable to a model of your choice (e.g. gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, command-r, command-r-plus, etc).
